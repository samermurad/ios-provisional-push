# Provisional iOS Notifications

A Simple project to demonstrate iOS 12+ Provisional Push Notifications Access


## Pre Requirements

In order to successfully run and test this project, you'll need:

- An iOS Developer Membership
- iOS Device
- APNs Service Key (in order to integrate with Apple's APNS)

### Optional but Recommended
The NodeJS Example project that implements Apple's APN, [source code](https://github.com/samermurad/simple-apns-example).

This step is not a must, but the project already implements the required api calls that integrates with the express app, so using the example project is the quickest way to test this project


## Goal

To demonstrate The capability of Provisional Push Notifications Acess, which gives us developer a "grace" access for Local and Push Notifications even without explicitly asking the user for Permissions.
